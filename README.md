# Multiple_func_cpp

A simple example C++ program to demonstrate the use of user-defined functions using multiple files in the program.

First, add a declaration for each function in main.cpp.

Now, write all of the function definitions in my_functions.cpp.

Finally, compile and execute the code. Remember to link the two .cpp files when compiling.
